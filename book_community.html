        <h2 class="main__text">Find your book community?</h2>
        <p class="main__subtitle">
          Looking for a book club? Whether you want to connect over brunch or
          booze, explore history, cozy up with a mystery, explore other
          cultures, become more mindful, or find support, there's a club out
          there for you.
        </p>

        <h2 class="main__text">About our community</h2>
        <p class="main__subtitle">
          In times of stress and pressurized news agenda, many people are
          looking for a safe and calm space. This can be a book club: discussing
          literature distracts you from your anxious reality and helps you
          gather a community of interest. A book club is a place free from
          judgment, evaluation, imposition of opinions and competition.
        </p>

        <h2 class="main__text">How we do things?</h2>
        <p class="main__subtitle">
          We chat in a chat room on Telegram. We'll call you there after we
          receive your request. We have a book discussion about once a month on
          Saturday from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm online. In addition to books, we
          sometimes meet and discuss movies or TV series on the Club's topics.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">
          Join a supportive community of people who care about the environment
          and read with us. We choose books to read together, as long as they
          are in line with the goals of sustainable development (sustainable
          consumption, reducing inequality, sustainable cities, etc.). Every 4-5
          weeks we meet to discuss what we have read and ask questions of
          experts.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">
          The book club is open to everyone regardless of immersion in the topic
          of frugal consumption and sustainable development. The only condition
          is to participate and spread the knowledge gained among friends,
          family, colleagues, and subscribers.
