          Participating in a book club motivates you to read more often and on a
          regular basis, and helps you broaden your horizons.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">
          It is a good opportunity to meet new people, discuss your favorite
          books, look at them in a new way, and also to learn to be brave enough
          to express your opinion.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">
          Another advantage of a book club is the sharing of experience and
          knowledge among its participants.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">
          Through reading books together, we create a community of like-minded
          people around us, even though their age, gender, profession and literary
          taste may differ.
