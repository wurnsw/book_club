          The Now So Book Club is a whole universe of like-minded people who are
          on a path of careful consumption. I like the club because at the
          meetings we share our real emotions from the book we read. Gently and
          gently we discuss different points of view. Brainstorm and learn from
          the experiences of others. After the discussion, one is filled with even
          more energy to accomplish feats of careful living.

          Book club motivates me to read more. I like that we choose books
          democratically - whichever one wins, we read that one. I also love that
          I have developed a habit of writing down thoughts and questions that
          come up while reading that I want to discuss with the club. It makes the
          reading process more thoughtful. And of course, I just love the
          atmosphere in our cozy chat room.

          In the book club I like the friendly atmosphere, mutual exchange of
          impressions, knowledge and useful links to movies, books and articles.
          The club gives an opportunity to delve into the topics that are touched
          upon in the books and discuss them with other members.

          It just so happened that the Book Club was spun off from the Careful
          Consumption Club, and I migrated from there as well. I'm very glad it
          happened that way. I never liked reading books, but the club opened up a
          world of eco-themed books for me. Now I read more than ever! Sometimes
          it is very hard to find time to read even a book I have already chosen,
          but thanks to the club I always have time, and the club will always help
          me with the choice of literature.

          I came to the club for a community of people with similar views, and
          also for books, because I caught myself that I started to read only
          fiction, and I would like to read serious non-fiction books too. For me,
          the club is a motivation to read and read thoughtfully, not
          superficially. And also a club meeting is a nice event in my calendar
          that I can look forward to .

          Over the past year, the book club has become the most enjoyable event
          for me in the field of conscious consumption: it's a pleasant
          socializing in a community of like-minded people, discussing interesting
          books, and communicating with experts in a variety of fields. The club
          has gathered a lot of amazing interesting people from various spheres
          and I am glad to be acquainted with them. And meetings to discuss books
          I've read always reveal something new and useful, even when it seems
          that the book is not interesting at all.

          The book club gives me a sense of a community of like-minded and
          like-hearted people, it's very valuable to me. I would definitely
          recommend joining the club to those who lack the feeling of a comrade's
          shoulder . I also find it difficult to concentrate on one and the same
          thing, and I often “atomize” my attention to many different books and
          other sources of information, and the club helps me to deepen my
          knowledge in the same area, to explore it from different angles.
